# Cat or Dog Classifier üê±üê∂

This project contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images as either a cat or a dog. The model has been trained on a dataset of images, with preprocessing and data augmentation techniques applied to improve performance.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Build a CNN to classify images into two categories: cats and dogs.
- Preprocess and augment the dataset for better model generalization.
- Test the model's performance on unseen data.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used consists of:
- **Training Set**: A collection of images of cats and dogs stored in `dataset/training_set/`.
- **Test Set**: A separate set of images stored in `dataset/test_set/`.
- **Single Prediction**: A folder `dataset/single_prediction/` containing individual test images for prediction.

---

## Model Architecture

The model uses the following architecture:
1. **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from images.
2. **Pooling Layers**: Reduce the dimensionality of feature maps.
3. **Fully Connected Layers**: Perform final classification.

### Layers
- **Conv2D**: Filters = 32, Kernel Size = 3x3, Activation = ReLU
- **MaxPooling2D**: Pool Size = 2x2, Strides = 2
- **Flatten**
- **Dense**: Units = 128, Activation = ReLU
- **Output Layer**: Units = 1, Activation = Sigmoid

## Results

### Training and Validation Performance
- **Final Training Accuracy**: ~90%
- **Final Validation Accuracy**: ~78%

`cat_or_dog_1.jpg`

Predicted Output:
```
cat
```
