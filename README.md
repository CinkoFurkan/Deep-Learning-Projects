# Deep Learning Projects by Furkan Çinko

Welcome to my deep learning project repository! This repository showcases a diverse range of deep learning projects, utilizing various architectures and techniques to solve complex problems across multiple domains.

---

## Overview

Deep learning is revolutionizing the way we approach data-driven solutions. This repository includes projects that demonstrate the application of popular deep learning models like Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), Boltzmann Machines, Autoencoders, and more.

Each project reflects my efforts in understanding, building, and optimizing these models for tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and feature extraction.
